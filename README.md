# Better Science Understanding with Sympy

Most people tend to stay away from math and physics as they consider these things to be scary. Person who works with those subjects has to withstand the complexity and tedious arithmetic manipulation. However, the computation power these days has made it easier to do math and physics. Our pathway to understanding the nature of math and physics becomes even easier with computer algebra system (CAS) on our side.

There are many CAS software to support our problems. Yet one of the biggest community support open source language, Python, own it’s own library for CAS as well namely Sympy. Sympy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It allows us to compute the mathematical expression. More than just mere calculator, Sympy is not only able to solve problem numerically, but also symbolic maths such as variables, function, differential, matrices, and so on.

This tutorial is aimed to give gentle introduction of Sympy’s fundamental to every one. We promote Sympy to people so it can be more widely used among the student, engineer, programmer, practitioner, or even lecture. We try to serve the demonstration on how this cool module can help them with their homework, project, or even job. Not to collapse the essence of manual hand work on math, but we want to give another approach on how people can understand science better.
